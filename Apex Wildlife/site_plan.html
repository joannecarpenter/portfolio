                Style Guide
            </h2>
            <h3>Color Schema</h3>
            <p>The following colors were chosen to represent the colors found in nature, promoting a calm, down-to-earth atmosphere for advertising services dealing with animals.</p>
            <p>Palette URL: <a href="https://coolors.co/user/palettes/650351b9294f47000c878519" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/user/palettes/650351b9294f47000c878519</a></p>

            <h3>
                Typography
            </h3>
                <h4>
                    Heading Font: Open Sans, Regular 400
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The heading font is professional and blends well with the font used on the business logo.
                </p>

                <h4>
                    Paragraph Font: Montserrat, Regular 400
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The paragraph font is wider than the headline font and still easily readable in small text. This sans serif font also continues the relaxed feel of this website. It provides enough variation from the headline font to promote separation without interrupting the website's reading flow.
